Mr.,Eric,Rasmussen,rasmussen@InSTEDD.org>,"Eric Rasmussen is a clinical physician boarded in Internal Medicine, formerly Chair of an academic Department of Medicine, and with 15 years experience specializing in disaster and humanitarian medicine. He's currently working with the US and Mexican governments focused on improving the resilience of urban slum dwellers in the six most hazardous cities in Mexico. He's the Vice-President for Humanitarian Systems for AccessAgility and a Research Professor in Environmental Epidemiology and Global Health in San Diego.  ","Dr. Eric Rasmussen is a medical doctor currently serving as Research Professor for Environmental Security and Global Medicine at San Diego State University, as an Affiliate Associate Professor of Medicine at the University of Washington, as a Public Policy Fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Institute for International Scholars within the Smithsonian Institution, and as Vice-President for Humanitarian Systems at Access Agility, a Virginia company specializing in vulnerability reduction for systems and populations. Dr. Rasmussen retired in 2010 as President and Chief Executive Officer of InSTEDD, a Google-founded NGO specializing in humanitarian support through technology and education. Before his selection as CEO of InSTEDD, Dr. Rasmussen had spent 25 years on active duty with the US Navy, including more than 15 deployments to multiple natural disasters and three wars. On his Navy retirement he was both Chairman of the Department of Medicine within the Navy hospital near Seattle, Washington, and Special Advisor in Humanitarian Informatics for the US Office of the Secretary of Defense. He has been a Principal Investigator for both the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and for the National Science Foundation, and he sits on several boards, including the National Academy of Science’s Committee on Grand Challenges in International Development.Enlisting in the Navy at age 17, Dr. Rasmussen spent seven years in nuclear submarines before leaving the Navy to receive his undergraduate and medical degrees from Stanford University. After graduate work in molecular biology at Los Alamos National Laboratory and teaching in Haiti, he completed a Residency in Internal Medicine and re-entered the Navy as Chief Resident in Medicine at the Navy Medical Center in Oakland, California. Subsequent Navy positions over a 25-year career included time as physician-at-sea aboard the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) and the cruiser USS Yorktown (CG-48), and three deployments to Bosnia, two to Afghanistan, ten months associated with the Iraq War (at Central Command in Tampa, in Kuwait, and in Baghdad), and three years as Fleet Surgeon for the US Navy’s Third Fleet. In 2001 Dr. Rasmussen completed an additional European Master’s Degree in Disaster Medicine (MDM) from the UN World Health Organization’s Centre European pour la Médecine des Catastrophes (CEMEC) in Italy. Later, in 2002, he served on the Afghanistan humanitarian support planning staff within US Central Command Headquarters (CENTCOM), and, in early 2003, as a humanitarian response physician on the Iraq Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) for the opening of the Iraq War. As a member of the DART, he was also medical advisor for the International Humanitarian Operations Center in Kuwait. For his work on the design and effective implementation of humanitarian information flow during the first stages of the Iraq war he was awarded DARPA’s 2003 “Sustained Excellence in a Principle Investigator” award.Further work as Director of the Strong Angel series of international humanitarian support demonstrations led to work in Afghanistan in 2004 and 2007, and in Indonesia as head of a Civil-Military Coordination Team for the tsunami response in Banda Aceh in early 2005. Later in 2005, he deployed with the Joint Task Force in New Orleans, coordinating a small portion of the relief response after Hurricane Katrina. In early January 2010 he deployed to Haiti for liaison work with the UN’s Search and Rescue Dispatch Center on the Port au Prince airfield.In 2011 he began working with the US government and the Government of Mexico on disaster risk reduction within the urban slum populations of the six most hazardous cities in Mexico. The risk reduction techniques incorporate data preparedness, local educational facilities, and resilience training for both natural and technological disasters, and the materials are easily localized into relevant languages. That work will continue into the foreseeable future. In addition to his current teaching and research responsibilities, he serves as Permanent Advisor to the UN Secretary-General's High-Level Expert Panel on Water Disasters and has several occasional teaching positions, including within the European Union’s Disaster Training Academy in Bonn, Germany and at Stanford University. He has more than twenty publications and has been awarded a number of personal, unit, and theater military decorations, including the Presidential Legion of Merit.Dr. Rasmussen lives on Bainbridge Island, near Seattle, and has been married for more than 25 years to Demi. He has daughters Melissa and Faith."

Mr.,Glenn,Pearson,gpearson@mail.nih.gov,"Glenn Pearson, at the US National Library of Medicine and with Aquilent, Inc., is a computer scientist with particular interest in man-machine interfaces and protocol standardizations.  His main current project is the Sahana Vesuvius based “Lost Person Finder” (LPF), of which is a co-leader. Glenn has also programmed a C#/WinForms wireless triage station application, “TriagePic”, to gather victim photos and information, as one input source to LPF.  Glenn is serving on the “Tracking Emergency Clients” Steering Committee and participants in Missing Person Summits organized by Crisis Commons.  He has mentored Sahana Google Summer of Code students for several years, as well as NLM student interns.","Glenn Pearson has been based at the Department of Health and Human Resources, National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM), Communications Engineering Branch (CEB).  Besides the LPF project, described above, other efforts for CEB follow.Glenn helped lead and code “Nursing Home Screener”, an experimental web resource to help the public quickly find and evaluate nursing homes by geolocation and quality.  The implementation was as a Google Maps “mashup” with Ajax-style controls, using C#, Javascript, and a MySQL backend.  Backend preprocessing was primarily in C#.  Later project emphasis was on offering content through web services.Glenn has built several C++/MFC software modules for the second generation of NLM's ""MARS"" project. MARS applies image processing and artificial intelligence to input biomedical journal abstracts and citations into NLM’s renowned MedLine database. These SQL Server/ADO clients run under Windows (XP through 7). The most significant two are ""CheckIn"" and ""PROD"". CheckIn, the start of the MARS document workflow, fetches XML data for a particular journal issue from upstream library systems and creates the initial local database record. PROD, a high-performance multi-threaded daemon, interfaces a 5-engine OCR engine to the MARS image repository and database.Another initiative extended the “Turning the Pages (TTP)” kiosk product, which portrays select pages from rare books in a novel manner. Initially, two such presentations, developed jointly by NLM and the British Library using Macromedia Director and other tools, were available. These were extended with a global index, rapid-flip positioning, and time-out warning.  For ""Vesalius’ Anatomy"", four ""Tales"" were scripted and added, short multimedia segments that flip the book to particular pages and bring in complementary images, movies, animations, narration, and text crawls, and were shown in a “Dream Anatomies” public exhibit. Subsequently, NLM has developed historic works as TTP independent of the British Library.Glenn has also been involved in NLM’s analysis of video technology regarding streaming, indexing, digitalization, and preservation of library assets.Prior to NLM, Glenn was a senior computer scientist at Civilized Software, Inc. (Bethesda, MD) from 1988 to 1996. He extended the company’s ""MLAB"" mathematical modeling software, wrote numerous successful grant proposals, and directed or participated in a number of scientific software/hardware projects. Earlier software development experience included work at Lever Brothers Research (Edgewater, NJ) and EIC, Inc (Newton, MA).Glenn received his Computer Science Ph.D. from the University of Maryland at College Park in 1988. His undergraduate degree is in chemistry."
